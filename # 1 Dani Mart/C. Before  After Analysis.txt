ðŸ§¼ Solution - C. Before & After Analysis
---------------------------------------



**1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after
`2020-06-15`? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and
percentage of sales?**


**Answer:**


``` {.sql}
SELECT 
  DISTINCT week_number
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE week_date = '2020-06-15' 
  AND calendar_year = '2020'
```


``` {.sql}
WITH changes AS (
  SELECT 
    week_date, 
    week_number, 
    SUM(sales) AS total_sales
  FROM clean_weekly_sales
  WHERE (week_number BETWEEN 21 AND 28) 
    AND (calendar_year = 2020)
  GROUP BY week_date, week_number
),
changes_2 AS (
  SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 21 AND 24 THEN total_sales END) AS before_change,
    SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND 28 THEN total_sales END) AS after_change
  FROM changes)

SELECT 
  before_change, 
  after_change, 
  after_change - before_change AS variance, 
  ROUND(100 * (after_change - before_change) / before_change,2) AS percentage
FROM changes_2
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?**


**Answer:**

``` {.sql}
WITH changes AS (
  SELECT 
    week_date, 
    week_number, 
    SUM(sales) AS total_sales
  FROM clean_weekly_sales
  WHERE (week_number BETWEEN 13 AND 37) 
    AND (calendar_year = 2020)
  GROUP BY week_date, week_number
),
changes_2 AS (
  SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 13 AND 24 THEN total_sales END) AS before_change,
    SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND 37 THEN total_sales END) AS after_change
  FROM changes)

SELECT 
  before_change, 
  after_change, 
  after_change - before_change AS variance, 
  ROUND(100 * (after_change - before_change) / before_change,2) AS percentage
FROM changes_2
```

**3. How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after
compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?**


**Part 1: How do the sale metrics for 4 weeks before and after compare
with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?** - Basically, the question is
asking us to find the sales variance between 4 weeks before and after
`'2020-06-15'` for years 2018, 2019 and 2020. Perhaps we can find a
pattern here. - We can apply the same solution as above and add
`calendar_year` into the syntax.

**Answer:**

``` {.sql}
WITH summary AS (
  SELECT 
    calendar_year, -- added new column
    week_number, 
    SUM(sales) AS total_sales
  FROM clean_weekly_sales
  WHERE (week_number BETWEEN 21 AND 28) 
  GROUP BY calendar_year, week_number
),
summary_2 AS (
  SELECT 
    calendar_year,
    SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 13 AND 24 THEN total_sales END) AS before_sales,
    SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND 28 THEN total_sales END) AS after_sales
  FROM summary
  GROUP BY calendar_year
)

SELECT 
  calendar_year, 
  before_sales, 
  after_sales, 
  after_sales - before_sales AS sales_variance, 
  ROUND(100 * (after_sales - before_sales) / before_sales,2) AS percentage
FROM summary_2
```


**Part 2: How do the sale metrics for 12 weeks before and after compare
with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?** - Use the same solution
above and change to week 13 to 24 for before and week 25 to 37 for
after.

``` {.sql}
WITH summary AS (
  SELECT 
    calendar_year, -- added new column
    week_number, 
    SUM(sales) AS total_sales
  FROM clean_weekly_sales
  WHERE (week_number BETWEEN 13 AND 37) 
  GROUP BY calendar_year, week_number
),
summary_2 AS (
  SELECT 
    calendar_year,
    SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 13 AND 24 THEN total_sales END) AS before_sales,
    SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND 37 THEN total_sales END) AS after_sales
  FROM summary
  GROUP BY calendar_year
)

SELECT 
  calendar_year, 
  before_sales, 
  after_sales, 
  after_sales - before_sales AS sales_variance, 
  ROUND(100 * (after_sales - before_sales) / before_sales,2) AS percentage
FROM summary_2
```
